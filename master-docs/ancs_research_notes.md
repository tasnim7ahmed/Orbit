# ANCS Research Notes

> **Pre-implementation research.** Kept for reference; see "Findings Since Implementation" at the end for what testing changed. Current behavior: [`../docs/protocol.md`](../docs/protocol.md).


## Key Findings

### ANCS is System-Level
- ANCS (Apple Notification Center Service) is built into iOS at the OS level
- No iOS app is required for basic notification forwarding
- The iPhone exposes ANCS automatically to any bonded BLE accessory
- All characteristics require authorization (pairing/bonding)

### Proven Implementations
- **Merge App** (commercial) — connects Wear OS to iPhone via BLE/ANCS
- **Aerlink for Android** (open-source, Kotlin) — GitHub: GuiyeC/Aerlink-for-Android
- **iOS-Wear-Connect** (open-source, Java fork of Aerlink)

### ANCS Protocol Reference

**Service UUID**: `7905F431-B5CE-4E99-A40F-4B1E122D00D0`

| Characteristic | UUID | Properties |
|---|---|---|
| Notification Source | `9FBF120D-6301-42D9-8C58-25E699A21DBD` | Notifiable |
| Control Point | `69D1D8F3-45E1-49A8-9821-9BBDFDAAD9D9` | Writable with response |
| Data Source | `22EAC6E9-24D6-4BB5-BE44-B36ACE7C7BFB` | Notifiable |

**Notification Source payload (8 bytes)**:
- Byte 0: EventID (0=Added, 1=Modified, 2=Removed)
- Byte 1: EventFlags (bitmask: Silent=0x01, Important=0x02, PreExisting=0x04, PositiveAction=0x08, NegativeAction=0x10)
- Byte 2: CategoryID (0-11)
- Byte 3: CategoryCount
- Bytes 4-7: NotificationUID (uint32 LE)

**Category IDs**: Other(0), IncomingCall(1), MissedCall(2), Voicemail(3), Social(4), Schedule(5), Email(6), News(7), HealthAndFitness(8), BusinessAndFinance(9), Location(10), Entertainment(11)

**Notification Attribute IDs**: AppIdentifier(0), Title(1), Subtitle(2), Message(3), MessageSize(4), Date(5), PositiveActionLabel(6), NegativeActionLabel(7)

**Important**: Variable-length attributes (Title, Subtitle, Message, action labels) require a 2-byte LE max-length parameter in the Control Point request. Fixed attributes (AppIdentifier, Date, MessageSize) do NOT.

**Subscribe to Data Source BEFORE Notification Source** (Apple recommendation).

### BLE Connection Flow
1. Watch scans for iPhone
2. connectGatt() with TRANSPORT_LE
3. discoverServices() — ANCS not visible (not bonded yet)
4. createBond() — iOS pairing dialog
5. BOND_BONDED — discoverServices() again — ANCS visible
6. Subscribe DS CCCD → Subscribe NS CCCD → session active

### Known Limitations
- ANCS does not provide app icons (must be bundled on watch)
- No audio forwarding (calls can be answered/declined but audio stays on iPhone)
- Data Source responses can be fragmented across multiple GATT notifications
- NotificationUIDs are session-scoped (invalid after disconnect)
- Cannot hook into native Wear OS phone app (must build custom call UI)

### iOS 26.3+ Changes
- Apple added explicit "Notification Forwarding" option for third-party wearables
- EU regulations pushing Apple to open notification access

## Findings Since Implementation

Verified on an iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 27) with a Pixel Watch 3 41 mm (Android 17):

- **No scanning needed for pairing**: the watch advertises with an ANCS service-solicitation UUID; iOS lists it in Settings → Bluetooth and connects when tapped. No iOS app required.
- **NotificationUIDs restart at 0 after a reconnect** — the same UID can mean a different notification in the next session. Watch notification IDs must not be derived from UIDs; items are re-linked by content as iOS re-announces them.
- **iOS 27 adds extra tuples** to Data Source responses (attribute `0xFF` length 0, then a repeated AppIdentifier, after each action label) — parse by attribute ID, not position.
- **Category 12** (undocumented) is sent for a call in progress after it's answered, with negative action "End Call".
- **More built-in services are usable once bonded**: Apple Media Service (now playing + remote control), Battery Service, Current Time Service.
- **iPhone Clock alarms don't arrive over ANCS.**
- **App icons**: ANCS gives only the bundle ID, but Apple's public App Store lookup API maps it to the app's official artwork.
